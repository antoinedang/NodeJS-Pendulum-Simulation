# Simple NodeJS/JS/CSS Pendulum Simulation
 Challenged to make a simple nodeJS REST API and pure JS/CSS user interface which can simulate 5 pendulums swinging, with some variables that can be adjusted by the user (length, weight, simulation time scale, etc.). Project in the scope of Vention Internship for Summer 2023.
